# Please note

As far as I know, iCircuit only runs on modern Macintosh machines. It's a cheapish (AU$3, US$2???) paid app available in the App Store. Feel free if you want to transcribe this provisional circuit diagram to KiCAD or other formats. You can upload them via pull request. See Modified MIT licence for details about any commercial use of files in this project.
