# Tape2MIDI2Tape
An experiment in recording MIDI clock and other data to "tape" (eg 48k/96k.192k digital recorders without sync capabilities) and syncing MIDI systems to "tape" playback. This project is pure hardware, with no code, but I may merge "RetroGnome" with it as an included master clock system for recording..
